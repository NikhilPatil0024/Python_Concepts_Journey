# Python Concepts Archive
This archive groups core Python concepts with small, runnable examples.
#Each file prints a tiny demo so you can run topics independently.
#Tip: Open in VS Code and run files with Python extension.
#Note: These are the very basic level of examples. It won't take you anywhere if you don't wonder and practice enough with more examples and problems. Yet it covers the core concpets that are actually needed to start.
